# MLP Classifier on CoverType Dataset

## Description
This project uses a Multi-Layer Perceptron and the CoverType Dataset to predict forest cover types using cartographic variables for 30x30 meter cells, with data derived from USFS and USGS sources. It analyzes four wilderness areas in the Roosevelt National Forest, which reflect ecological processes with minimal human disturbance.
